Core Functional Goals:
Efficiently traverse graphs using coordinated multi-agent behavior.

Enable each agent to operate with independent decision-making while contributing to a shared memory pool.

Replace the need for traditional BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra by combining search, pathfinding, and optimization in one.

Implement an agent fusion mechanism to combine findings from multiple agents into one optimal path.

Achieve dynamic fault tolerance through redundancy and fallback strategies between agents.

Support both directed and undirected graphs, including weighted and unweighted edges.

Optimize traversal in real-time or near real-time across large and complex graphs (e.g., social networks, road maps, logistics).

Incorporate analytic memory to prevent repetitive or redundant exploration.

Allow plug-in adaptability for domain-specific heuristics (e.g., network routing, rescue operations, AI-based simulations).

Enable flow-based extension (MAFS-Flow) for applications like distributed decision-making, search-and-rescue simulations, and load balancing.
