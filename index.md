Development Blueprint: This blueprint is a structured development plan for implementing and validating MAFS. The implementation is currently in progress, and milestones will be completed iteratively.

Time Complexities: These bounds represent theoretical expectations under ideal fusion assumptions and will be validated experimentally during benchmarking.

Behavior Analysis: Parts of the documentation were refined using AI writing tools, while the algorithm design, framework, and research direction are original.
