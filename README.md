# MAFS-Research
Multi-Agent Fusion Search (MAFS) and MAFS-Flow algorithm development.
MAFS (Multi-Agent Fusion Search) is a novel graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that integrates concepts of multi-agent cooperation, memory fusion, and dynamic route optimization. Designed as a conceptual and practical alternative approach to traversal and shortest-path discovery under dynamic constraints, MAFS introduces intelligent agent coordination to improve speed, fault tolerance, and adaptability in complex networks.
